## How to contribute

Initializr is here to kick-start the development 
of your new projects. It generates templates based on
 HTML5 Boilerplate by allowing you to choose which part
 s you want or don't want from it. A responsive template 
 has also been added to start from a basic design instead 
 of a blank page.
